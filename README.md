flight Centre Tech Task

So first I decided to go with the MVP design pattern.

I started off building my network services  and model objects then I created my presenter for the results page. I started writing tests for my presenter as I found that was where most of the business logic was and for date parsing.
I  manged to mock the network services via a protocol and used this to iterate quickly and get feedback. After that I started working on the cell layout and view presentation I used storyboards and xib files.

After the results page was done I went on to the detail flight view which was fairly straight forward just required a few tweaks here and there in the storyboard to get the desired effect.

I think the mvp pattern worked well and i think my view controllers a pretty light weight and I've kept the views pretty dum which is always a good thing.

If you guys have any questions why I did things a certain way please ask
